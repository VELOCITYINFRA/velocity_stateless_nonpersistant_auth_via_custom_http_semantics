# RESONING AND NEED FOR 401 currently implemented Features



### Per route Custom service Logic :


```Why force every route through the same gate using a protocol when each door deserves its own key?```
```Route-specific logic means /gate  gate only that route   ,  /custom  run a custom logic for that endpoint etc```




### Jwt based wallet access control and gating :

```Sign-every-request forces signature verification + blockchain queries on every endpoint; JWT caches auth . Fast APIs, not slow gatekeepers```



### Optional One Request Per Wallet :


```One login per wallet means: you get ONE shot at access enabling exclusivity . No do-overs, no second chances```



### ```All using unified 401 protocol```
